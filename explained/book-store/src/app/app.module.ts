  // An entry component is any component that Angular loads imperatively,
  //   (which means youâ€™re not referencing it in the template), by type.
  //   You specify an entry component by bootstrapping it in an NgModule, or including it in a routing definition.

  // To contrast the two types of components, there are components which are included in the template,
  //   which are declarative. Additionally, there are components which you load imperatively; that is, entry components.
  //   the main application view, called the root component, that hosts all other app views.
  //   Only the root module should set this bootstrap property.

  // A bootstrapped component is an entry component that
  //   Angular loads into the DOM during the bootstrap process (application launch).
  //   Other entry components are loaded dynamically by other means, such as with the router.

  // There are two main kinds of entry components:
  //   The bootstrapped root component.
  //   A component you specify in a route definition.

// Why list the same component in multiple NgModule properties?

// AppComponent is often listed in both declarations and bootstrap. You might see the same component listed in declarations, exports, and entryComponents.
// While that seems redundant, these properties have different functions. Membership in one list doesn't imply membership in another list.
//   AppComponent could be declared in this module but not bootstrapped.
//   AppComponent could be bootstrapped in this module but declared in a different feature module.
//   A component could be imported from another app module (so you can't declare it) and re-exported by this module.
//   A component could be exported for inclusion in an external component's template as well as dynamically loaded in a pop-up dialog.
